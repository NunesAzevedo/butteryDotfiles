# Buttery Dotfiles 🧈

My personal dotfiles for Arch Linux with Hyprland, Fedora with KDE and Windows 11, in multiboot., managed with **GNU Stow**.

## 📦 Contents

This repository contains configurations for:

* **Window Manager:** Hyprland (including Waybar, nwg-bar, nwg-look)
* **Terminal:** Kitty and Konsole
* **Shell:** Zsh (with Oh My Zsh and Oh My Posh)
* **Editor:** Neovim (NvChad/Custom)
* **Tools:** Tmux, Git, Yay, Btop, Cava, Ranger, Lazygit
* **Design:** GTK Themes, Icons, GIMP (PhotoGIMP setup)

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Ensure you have `git` and `stow` installed:

```bash
sudo pacman -S git stow

```

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your Home directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NunesAzevedo/butteryDotfiles.git ~/butteryDotfiles
cd ~/butteryDotfiles

```

2. **Apply configurations (Stow)**
For most packages, simply use Stow. This will automatically create symbolic links in `~/.config/` or `~/`.

```bash
# Example: install everything (except special folders like fonts)
stow .

# Or install package by package (recommended for testing)
stow zsh
stow nvim
stow kitty
stow hypr

```


## 🎨 GIMP (PhotoGIMP)

GIMP configurations have been cleaned to avoid "noise" from temporary files (`sessionrc`, `tool-options`, etc.). The repository tracks only essential settings, shortcuts, and preferences.

When launching GIMP for the first time, it will automatically recreate the necessary cache folders.

## 🔄 Updates

To make local changes and save them to the repository:

```bash
cd ~/butteryDotfiles
git add .
git commit -m "update: description of changes"
git push

```


## 📦 Package Management

To keep track of installed software and restore it on a new machine, I use a script along with package lists generated by `pacman`.

### Backup (Generating Lists)

To save your currently installed packages to the repository lists:

```bash
# Save official packages (native)
pacman -Qqe > pkglist_native.txt

# Save AUR packages
pacman -Qqm > pkglist_aur.txt

```

### Restore (Installing on a new system)

To install all packages (Official + AUR) on a fresh Arch Linux installation:

1. Ensure you are in the repository root.
2. Run the install script:

```bash
chmod +x install_packages.sh
./install_packages.sh

```

**What the script does:**

* Installs `base-devel` (prerequisite for compiling).
* Installs `yay` manually if it's missing (bootstrapping).
* Reads `pkglist_native.txt` and installs packages via `pacman`.
* Reads `pkglist_aur.txt` and installs packages via `yay`.

```
